# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Coursework
## Introduction
The purpose of this program is reduce the size of text files and decompress them at the same time to get back the original files contents.
## Prerequisites
Lastest version of Python to be installed onto users computer (current lastest version Python 3.9),
Following Python modules to be installed onto user computer:
-bitstring
Stable internet connection required too.
## Installation
Following Python modules to be installed onto user computer through command prompt: 
-bitstring
## Getting started tutorial 
Navigate to the bottom of the file and uncomment paths for required amount of tests,
change path(n) to file name which ever text file you would like to compress - with '.txt' at end,
change binary_file(n) and output_file(n) to whatever name you would like - I recommend using the same name as the original file but with compressed and decompressed 
at end respectively. Make sure binary_file(n) ends with '.bin' and output_file(n) ends with .'txt'.
Run program on command prompt using following command "python huffman_test.py" in appropiate directory.
