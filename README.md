## Getting started tutorial 
Navigate to the bottom of the file and uncomment paths for required amount of tests,
change path(n) to file name which ever text file you would like to compress - with '.txt' at end,
change binary_file(n) and output_file(n) to whatever name you would like - I recommend using the same name as the original file but with compressed and decompressed 
at end respectively. Make sure binary_file(n) ends with '.bin' and output_file(n) ends with .'txt'.
Run program on command prompt using following command "python huffman_test.py" in appropiate directory.
